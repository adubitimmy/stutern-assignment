    <h2>Tutorials and How-to</h2>
    <p>Tutorials and How-to guides are probably the simplest type of blog post you can work on. They are easy because they involve you talking about things you are already familiar with such as your product or service. The most important thing when it comes to how-to guides is to break down your tutorial into the smallest steps and into the simplest terms. Don’t assume your readers know what they’re doing — this is a tutorial, remember?.</p>
